# WeatherrAPI

The Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is designed to monitor weather conditions in major Indian metropolitan cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The system continuously fetches real-time weather data, processes it to generate daily rollups and aggregates, and issues alerts based on user-defined thresholds. The goal is to provide summarized insights into weather conditions and display visualizations for trend analysis.
